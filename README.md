Steganography project that have to hide Antigona text written by Sofokles in Internet traffic

You need to have WinDivert libary to use projects because it is reading Internet traffic that was captured by Wireshark and saved as *.pcap

This repo contains 3 diffrent projects:

1. TrafficModifier - the job of this program is to hide and encrypt text in internet traffic  like opening a Website.
2. NinjaReader - This program have to decrypt hidden text and show at real time how does encrypted (for example Antygona) text looks.
3. MessageFinder - Last program have to wrote if saved captured traffic (*.pcap) contains hidden message.

I got 15 prepared pcap-s those are huge so I wont put them in this repo. They are available for request :)
